A subscriber can add items to their ATB cart up until a specified date (displayed on their landing page). The date historically has changed, but as of November 2021, we will charge them on the 29th of the month and their addons expire at midnight, also on the 29th. When a customer adds items to their cart, it automatically reserves them. Reserved carts can be adjusted by the customer until we bill them.

Customers purchase ATB from their ATB “landing page” which they can access in a few ways: an email campaign we send them or via their account dashboard. We show an ATB promo on the dashboard as long as they have unexpired ATB offers for a current or future month.
