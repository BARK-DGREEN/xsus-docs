# Billing

Billing is currently run manually each month by payments squad devs via a script. An ongoing ATB billing document can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zkjoVMLX113rwAIrDcXTbe9os2pbkmq0F6kstZADcWo/edit?usp=sharing). There are three rounds of billing times: First round of billing is the 1st/2nd of the month. Second round is the 4/5th of the month. And the third round is the 9/10th to catch any stragglers/people who were past due. The payments squad is working to automate billing on a customers renewal day but that work is not yet 100% live.
